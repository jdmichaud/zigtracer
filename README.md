# zigtracer
A simple path-tracer in Zig. Continuing a tradition of learning new languages by writing a path-tracer, this follows
[Go](https://github.com/msinilo/gotracer) and [Rust](https://github.com/msinilo/rtracer) versions.
Pretty much 1:1 conversion of the Rust version, with 'handmade' simple work pool.
Note: build with version 0.9.0 or later.

A short write-up [here](http://msinilo.pl/blog2/post/zig-pathtracer/).
